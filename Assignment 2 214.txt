ITERATOR:

Create an iterator struct which contains:
- a pointer ot one of these nodes
the value that holds the data 
the reference counter
pointer to next node

Create Iterator:
Create iterator, which points to first element in the list. Increment reference count in that node.

Traverse the iterator:
Get next node. 
Decrement the ref. count at the current node, and increment ref. count at the new node.

Delete the iterator:
Have the iterator point to null, and then decrement the node reference count.
If reference count becomes zero, delete the node.


Eg: Get the fourth value in the list
Create the iterator
Call iterator get next four times
VALUES SHOULD EXIST INDEPENDENT OF THE ITERATOR
